/**
 * In the current raider event, the soldier count is based on a very simple formula: garrison size + total settlement
 * population / 30 + soldier count of all armies in the target region of the raiding army + 0.5 * soldier count of all
 * player armies in player-owned regions + 0.25 * soldier count of all player armies in neutral regions
 * <p>
 * If we assume that the player does not have any armies anywhere, the settlement population is 500, and the garrison
 * size is 0, the formula would be: 0 + 500 / 30 + 0 + 0.5 * 0 + 0.25 * 0 â‰ˆ 17 soldiers in the raiding army.
 * <p>
 * This can be easily exploited by the player, as they can simply assemble 50+ soldiers when they receive the Protection
 * event, defeat the incoming army, and then disband their garrison. Collect the armor and weapons from the defeated
 * raider armies, and the player doesn't have to worry about the increasing raiding army quality due to the winning
 * scaling factor.
 * <p>
 * Instead, I'd like to base the incoming raiding army size and quality on the player's settlement wealth. The player's
 * wealth will be distributed between raider soldier count, armor and weapon quality, with scaling modifiers applied for
 * balancing. To calculate the value of a settlement pawn, we can use the resource consumption of a pawn over a certain
 * amount of time, with scaling modifiers applied to compensate for the pawn's fighting effectiveness.
